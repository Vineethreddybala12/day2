# Titanic Data Analysis - Beginner Friendly Visual Interface

This project performs a simple, beginner-friendly analysis of the Titanic dataset using basic Python libraries. It focuses on exploring **numeric features** such as `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass`, `sibsp`, `Parch`, and survival status.

## ðŸ“Œ Features Covered

### âœ… 1. Central Tendency
- **Mean** â€“ Average of each numeric column.
- **Median** â€“ Middle value of each numeric column.
- **Mode** â€“ Most frequently occurring value.

### âœ… 2. Histograms
- Visual representation of the distribution for numeric features.
- Helps spot skewed data or gaps.

### âœ… 3. Box Plots
- Highlights outliers in each numeric column.
- Shows minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum.

### âœ… 4. Pair Plot
- Visualizes relationships between pairs of features.
- Helps understand feature clustering or separation.

### âœ… 5. Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)
- Displays correlation (from -1 to +1) between numeric columns.
- Useful for identifying linear relationships.

### âœ… 6. Anomaly Detection (via Box Plots)
- Outliers shown as dots in box plots.
- Helpful in preprocessing and data cleaning.
